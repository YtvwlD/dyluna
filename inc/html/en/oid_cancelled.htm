				If you really meant to do this, you can now <a href="#" onlick="self.close(); return false;">close</a> this window.

				If this happened by accident or you changed your mind, you may repeat the login, of course. But you still need to <a href="#" onlick="self.close(); return false;">close</a> this window first.
